  A recreation of Lethal Company with working online multiplayer using Steam, so no port forwarding is required! This game was made with the Godot Engine and GodotSteam.
  
  Make sure you have Steam running in the background when attempting to launch the game. If launched successfully, Steam will show you playing "space wars". Max Players allowed on a server as of right now is 3.
